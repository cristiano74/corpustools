\title{Create a document term matrix}
\arguments{
\item{feature}{The name of the feature column}

\item{context_level}{Select whether the rows of the dtm should represent "documents" or "sentences".}

\item{weight}{Select the weighting scheme for the DTM. Currently supports term frequency (termfreq), document frequency (docfreq), term frequency inverse document frequency (tfidf) and tfidf with normalized document vectors.}

\item{drop_empty_terms}{If True, tokens that do not occur (i.e. column where sum is 0) are ignored.}

\item{form}{The output format. Default is a sparse matrix in the dgTMatrix class from the Matrix package. Alternatives are tm_dtm for a DocumentTermMatrix in the tm package format or quanteda_dfm for the document feature matrix from the quanteda package.}

\item{subset_tokens}{A subset call to select which rows to use in the DTM}

\item{subset_meta}{A subset call for the meta data, to select which documents to use in the DTM}

\item{context}{Instead of using the document or sentence context, an custom context can be specified. Has to be a vector of the same length as the number of tokens, that serves as the index column. Each unique value will be a row in the DTM.}

\item{context_labels}{If False, the DTM will not be given rownames}

\item{feature_labels}{If False, the DTM will not be given column names}

\item{ngrams}{Optionally, use ngrams instead of individual tokens. This is more memory efficient than first creating an ngram feature in the tCorpus.}

\item{ngram_before_subset}{If a subset is used, ngrams can be made before the subset, in which case an ngram can contain tokens that have been filtered out after the subset. Alternatively, if ngrams are made after the subset, ngrams will span over the gaps of tokens that are filtered out.}
