\title{Recode features in a tCorpus based on a search string}
\arguments{
\item{feature}{The feature in which to search}

\item{new_value}{the character string with which all features that are found are replaced}

\item{...}{See \link{tCorpus$search_features} for the query parameters}

\item{copy}{If TRUE, the method returns a new tCorpus object. This is the normal R way of doing things. Alternatively, the tCorpus can be used as a reference class object by setting copy to FALSE, or setting tCorpus$always_copy to FALSE to use this globally. Please consult the general documentation for tCorpus (?tCorpus) for a more detailed explanation.}
